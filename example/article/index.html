      <p>This is paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
        <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
        <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">

          <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
          <li>Third list item to close it out</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>Abbreviations, like <abbr>HTML</abbr> should use <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, with an optional <code>title</code> attribute for the full phrase.</li>
          <li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.</p>
